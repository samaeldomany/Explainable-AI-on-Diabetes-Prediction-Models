# Explainable-AI-on-Diabetes-Prediction-Models

## Overview

This project explores the application of various machine learning models for diabetes prediction using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, with a focus on evaluating and understanding model performance. It includes implementations of Logistic Regression, Neural Network, and XGBoost Classifier, along with their respective evaluation metrics.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. This dataset is commonly used for binary classification tasks and contains various diagnostic measurements to predict whether a patient has diabetes.

## Models
### Logistic Regression: A linear model for binary classification, known for its simplicity and interpretability.
### Neural Network: A more complex model capable of capturing non-linear relationships within the data.
### XGBoost Classifier: A powerful gradient boosting framework known for its high performance and efficiency.
